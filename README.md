# F1 Data Analytics with FastF1  

## About  
This repository documents my learning journey in **Data Analytics** and **Data Engineering** using the [FastF1](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/) library.  
As a Formula 1 fan since **June 2025**, I decided to combine my passion for motorsport with my curiosity about **data**. This project serves as my starting point to explore how raw racing data can be transformed into insights.  

I am motivated to pursue a career in **Data Analytics / Data Engineering** because I believe that **data is everywhere**—and unlocking its value can lead to exciting discoveries and smarter decisions.

## Goals  
- Learn how to collect, clean, and analyze F1 data using FastF1  
- Practice visualization techniques with **Matplotlib**, **Pandas**, and Python  
- Build a foundation in **data analysis** and **data engineering concepts**  
- Share progress, code, and insights publicly
